# hierarchical-dense-ssl
This repository contains implementation of the paper 'SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING OF DENSE HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATIONS FOR MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION' submitted to ISBI 2024.

Current version of code is fully-functional but still requiers adaptation for easy usage, grooming and documenation.
Code is based on https://github.com/mishgon/vox2vec.

19.12.2023: completed prepreprocessing of the data for pretraining.
20.12.2023: completed pretraining dataset.
21.12.2023: completed pretraining procedure.
24.12.2023: completed preprocessing of the data for downstream task.
28.12.2023: completed downstream dataset and downstream.

Next step: usage instructions.
